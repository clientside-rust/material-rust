# Clientside-Rust Governance

<p class="description">Clientside-Rust is an open source project that depends on contributions from the community.</p>

## Overview

Material-Rust is a project related to [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), a set of [React](https://reactjs.org/) components
that implement [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/design/introduction/)
specification. 

Our mission is to create a customizable, rust Material Design implementation for anyone to use. We value an open, collaborative, and diverse community where anyone can join in discussions, learn from one another, and contribute to the project. This document describes how we govern ourselves, how decisions are made, and how someone could engage with the project.
