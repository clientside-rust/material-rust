# material-rust
Material Design component library for websites that use yew (the nearest rust equivalent to react)

## In plain english please

Most websites are written in the javascript language. The Rust language makes it easier to build websites and apps that are super fast for the user, and time-effective to maintain and add working features to.

Material-UI is a "component library" (a collection of modular, composable, stylable UI widgets) built using a standard aesthetic convention ("material design"). It is a great way to quickly spin up a nice looking app or website for your business, so you can focus first on getting the product or service out there to your users and/or customers. Component libraries in general aim to save you and/or your team from "reinventing the wheel" or otherwise having to focus on design details, when what you really want to do is build your app and get it out there. Material UI is the most popular component library, which indicates the components it offers are practical and flexible enough to accommodate the most developers and teams.

Material-rust offers the same components, but you can use them in rust. You can build out a working web app or website, in very little time, and it will run faster for the user than if you had written it in javascript. It will also be able to support a lot of features without becoming extraordinarily time consuming to maintain.

To use components from a component library, you need to have a "component framework" that will display components and manage communication between them. Material-rust uses the "yew" framework, which is what makes using these components at all possible. Thank yew!

# is rust right for my project?

## Do you know rust, or are you willing to learn?

Rust is a language with very powerful features that, once you understand them, can make your life as a software engineeer a lot easier.

The key element is you have to be willing to learn a new and valuable skill.

If this is a project for a business, you probably see these upfront costs of developer time as upfront investment. That is true. Using rust in a business context is an investment proposition in lowering costs long-term, it is a proposition which over time becomes profitable in more and more situations as the rust ecosystem advances.

## How complicated will my app get?

If you are building an extraordinarily simple website with a clearly limited purpose, you can use rust.

If you are building an app or website that you think might become very complicated with a lot of different behavior, rust offers a lot of advantages?

## Am I already using an application framework for typescript or native javascript?

If you are already using an application framework that you do not want to migrate away from

# why a port

## material-ui's popularity speaks to practicality and flexibility.

The material-UI component library is not the "last chapter" of design. No software is perfect and Material-UI is not perfect either. But it is the most popular component library, and I think that suggest that it is flexible enough and fits the needs of the most developers and teams.

## make it easy for developers and teams to switch to rust

My goal is to make building web apps and websites on rust as easy as it is on javascript.

## make it easy to migrate apps and websites to rust then iterate from there.

Moving to rust is a much bigger leap, with a much bigger positive impact, than moving to a new component framework. Also I am not really qualified to build, or even recognize, what the next big component framework is.
